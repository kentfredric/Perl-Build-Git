NAME
    Perl::Build::Git - Convenience extensions for Perl::Build for bulk git
    work

VERSION
    version 0.001000

SYNOPSIS
    This is something that might be useful to call in a git bisect runner

        use Perl::Build::Git;
        my $install = Perl::Build::Git->install_git(
                persistent => 1,
                preclean   => 1,
                cache_root => '/tmp/perls/',
                git_root   => '/path/to/git/checkout',
        );
        $install->run_env(sub{
                # Test Case Here
                exit 255 if $failed;
        });
        exit 0;

    "persistent = 1" is intended to give each build its own unique
    directory, such as

        /tmp/perls/v5.17.10-44-g97927b0/

    So that if you do multiple bisects, ( for the purpose of testing which
    incarnation of perl some module fails in ), testing against a perl that
    was previously tested against in a previous bisect should return a
    cached result, greatly speeding up the bisect ( at the expense of disk
    space ).
